The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of commercial corridors within the CRA of St. Petersburg, Florida, since 2015. This analysis will examine the yearly fluctuations and general trends in property values and provide valuable insights for individuals or organizations interested in real estate development or investment in St. Petersburg. Additionally, the project aims to examine private investment across various corridors, including investment patterns over time, new building counts, total construction costs, renovated building counts, average/median construction values, and total construction values. The findings of this analysis will also highlight the allocation of private investment in different corridors, indicating which corridors have received the highest and lowest amounts of investment. Overall, this research will provide critical information that can inform important business decisions related to developing, leasing, buying, or investing in the area.

I have used Tableau-prep builder, Tableau desktop, and MS Excel for the purposes of an EDA.
